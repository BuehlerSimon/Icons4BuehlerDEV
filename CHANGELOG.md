**Icons refreshed/updated: August 1st 2020**

- Reorg and rename!
- Added the new official icon set from the Azure Architecture Center
- Renamed the previous 'azure-icons' set to 'azure-cds', and the above Azure Architecture Center icons are now called 'azure-icons'. This is confusing, sorry!
- Removed the 'cloud-old' set, no one should need this now.
