## Core Azure Sets

#### [Azure Patterns Collection](azure-patterns)
Probably the best place to start, 900+ icons including all Azure services, this has been scraped from https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/patterns/styles/glyphs-icons/ This is made public, as part of the "Sundog" Azure.com design system

#### [Azure Docs](azure-docs)
Scraped from main Azure docs site, all major Azure services are in here plus a couple of other useful icons. In many places this overlaps with the above set, but is a bit more focused on core Azure services making it easier to find what you are looking for.

This is the official "Microsoft Azure Cloud and AI Symbol / Icon Set - SVG" dated 15/05/2019 fetched from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=41937). This has many overlaps with the other sets, but also contains many unique icons. It's included here in entirety for completeness


## Other Sets

#### [Logos & Brands](logos)
Various product, company & programing language logos, hand picked & fetched from various sources online. Theses may or may not be directly Azure related

#### [Other Icons](other)
Many other Azure & Microsoft icons sourced from various places; Azure.com pages, Azure Docs git repo, Azure portal etc. Most of these are hand picked or moved here manually, these shouldn't overlap with the other sets, but may do
